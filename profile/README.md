### Themis is a forum software that has the following goals:
- It has good UX and UI.
- It is **accessible**, both disability-wise and to new users.
- It has good moderation tools.
- It is performant.
- It reads well on mobile and desktop, **not preferring** one over the other.
### Themis has some anti-goals:
- It **does not** focus on extensibility.
  - Instead, Themis should be comprehensive enough that **extensions are strictly unnecessary** for the vast majority of tasks.

Themis is two parts, a client called Vesta, written in Purescript, and a backend called Eunomia, written in OCaml.
